# Project Intelligence: Telegram Stars Exchange

## Project Structure
- Vue 3 with Composition API is used throughout the project
- Components are organized in src/views (pages) and src/components (reusable UI)
- Routing is handled by Vue Router with routes defined in src/router/index.ts
- State management uses Pinia with stores in src/stores/
- Telegram WebApp SDK integration is in src/composables/useTelegram.ts
- Helper functions are stored in src/utils/ directory

## Coding Patterns
- Composition API is preferred over Options API
- Use ref() and computed() from Vue for reactive state
- Async operations should handle errors with try/catch
- Tailwind CSS for styling with utility classes

## Component Structure
- Component files use .vue extension with script, template, and style tags
- Script section should use setup() function for Composition API
- Export reactive variables from setup() to make them available in template
- Use computed properties for derived state

## Authentication
- Telegram WebApp SDK is used for authentication
- User information is retrieved from Telegram.WebApp.initDataUnsafe.user
- Implementation is wrapped in the useTelegram() composable
- Mock environment is available in helper/telegramMock.ts

## API Integration
- API calls use the /api/* endpoints
- Fetch API is used for HTTP requests
- API responses should follow a consistent format
- Error handling should provide user feedback
